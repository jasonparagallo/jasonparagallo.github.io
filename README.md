## Projects
[Amazon Fake Product Detection Model](/assets/Amazon_Fake_Product_Model.ipynb)
- This was my final project for my Unstructured Data Analytics Course. The mission was to create a model that would effectively detect whether a listing on Amazon was selling a fake product or not using the reviews of that particular product. The team that I worked with and I individually provided each review (852) a numerical representation so our model could ingest the data. We labeled reviews not mentioning quality issues/knockoff concerns as a 0, reviews that mentioned the product was potentially a knockoff a 1, and reviews we were unsure of a 2.
    
[Yelp Restaurant Clustering](/assets/Clustering_Model.ipynb)
- This clustering model aimed to cluster restaurants of similar cuisines utilizing Yelp reviews from restaurants local to NJ and NY. The model was able to effectiveley decipher different styles of cuisine and group them with competitors.
  
[NHL Prediction Model](/assets/NHL_Prediction_Model.ipynb)
- This was my final project for my Structured Data Analytics course. Our class was tasked with creating an optomized artificial neural network that would predict an output variable. I decided to create a model that predicted the outcome of National Hockey League games. This project utilized data from [moneypuck](https://moneypuck.com/) and was particularly fun to run during the hockey season and compare the model results to actual outcomes of games.

[Various Machine Learning Models to Predict Yelp Restaurant Ratings](/assets/Preprocessing+LogisticRegression,SupportVectorMachine,DecisionTree,RandomForest,AdaBoost,NeuralNetwork,NaiveBayes.ipynb)
- This project utilized a pipeline to effectively run and return metric results for 7 different machine learning models using two different text preprocessing methods. The goal of this project was not to optimize the model itself but to see exactly what method of preprocessing worked best for each model.

[Word2Vec Preprocessing](/assets/Word2Vec_Model.ipynb)
- This project was my introduction to text preprocessing. I used 400 Yelp reviews and successfully preprocessed and removed punctuation, capital letters, and stopwords from every review.
